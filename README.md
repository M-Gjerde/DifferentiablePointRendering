# Differentiable Point Rendering

This is my implementation of **"Adjoint Differentiable Rendering for Optimizing Surfel Representations"**.

I built this project to reproduce the paper’s core idea: optimize beta surfels with an adjoint differentiable rendering pipeline, using photon mapping as a radiance cache during optimization.

It includes the renderer, optimization code, and sample scenes/point clouds I used for experiments.
